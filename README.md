# 3. Architecture
If you are new to flutter_redux, here's a brief introduction of how it works: 
1. A **Store** saves the **state**.
2. A **StoreConnector** listens to the state and creates/updates the UI.
3. The UI **dispatches** **actions**.
4. **Reducers** intercept these actions and update the state.
<br>

In this project, I extended this pattern by:
1. Adding a **ViewModel** to store the properties that define the UI.
2. Created a **redux_components** folder, to define an action and its reducer for each file.
3. Created a **redux_adapters** folder, to define a UI adapter and its ViewModel for each file.
<br>

A visual representation of the architecture of **FlutterAnimationsStudio** is shown in the image below:
